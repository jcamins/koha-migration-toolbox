1) Introduction

    These scripts were written by or for ByWater Solutions, for use in 
    migration and support of the Koha integrated library system.  We
    give them to the community, in the hope that others find them 
    useful.  Most should be fairly self-explanatory; if you have specific
    questions, please direct them to ByWater via:
    
    D Ruth Bavousett <ruth@bywatersolutions.com>
    Brendan Gallagher <brendan@bywatersolutions.com>

2) Generalities

    In all of the Perl scripts, Getopt::Long is used to process 
    command-line parameters.  Immediately after the call to GetOptions,
    mandatory parameters (if any) are checked.  No --help is provided in
    these scripts.  Most will have something hanging from the --debug flag, 
    but it may or may not be useful, depending on the debugging needs
    when the script was written.

    If a script is intended to change data on a running instance of Koha,
    it will support the --update flag.  Without this flag, no data will 
    be changed.

3) Perl Prerequisites

    The following modules are loaded for all or many of these scripts, so 
    you should ensure that you have necessary packages on your system.

    autodie qw(open close);
    strict;
    version;
    warnings;

    Carp;
    Data::Dumper;
    English qw( -no_match_vars );
    Getopt::Long;
    MARC::Batch;
    MARC::Charset;
    MARC::Field;
    MARC::Record;
    Readonly;
    Smart::Comments;
    Text::CSV_XS;
    Text::CSV::Simple;
    XML::Simple;

4) Submitting patches

    No one at ByWater suggests that these scripts are the be-all, end-all 
    of ILS migration tools; if you have enhancements that you are willing to 
    share, please send them, and we will include them!  A git patch would be
    the most-welcome way to do that, emailed to either of the addresses above.
